Terms of Service:
Operational Distinction and Service Classification
It is of paramount importance to explicitly define the nature of the engagement between the applicant and Zensoratech. The internship program is open-access and participation-based. Certification and formal recognition are merit-based and issued only upon successful completion and evaluation of assigned tasks. However, to facilitate the delivery of this program, we must distinguish between the professional opportunity and the administrative processing required to support it. The internship role is not for sale; rather, all fees charged are strictly for certification, administrative processing, evaluation, record verification, and certificate issuance, not for the internship offer itself. This clear separation ensures that the candidate is evaluated on skill, while the logistical costs are handled through a separate, tangible processing fee.

Administrative Verification and Code Review Costs
Upon the participant’s request for certification after successful completion of the internship, Zensoratech incurs immediate operational costs related to the management of the assessment workflow. We are explicitly charging for the administrative cost of verifying the user’s code and reviewing task submissions. This process requires significant resources to ensure that every submission is logged, checked for authenticity, and processed within our systems. The user acknowledges that this fee compensates the platform for the specific administrative overhead involved in tracking their progress and validating the technical integrity of their work throughout the program duration.

Allocation for Certification and ID Generation
A primary component of this fee is allocated to the formal credentialing process. Specifically, we are charging for the administrative expense of generating a unique ID for every participant and processing their final certification. This fee covers the setup required to issue a valid, tracked, and serialized certificate upon completion. By remitting the nominal amount of Ninety-Nine Indian Rupees, the user is covering the direct costs associated with establishing their unique identity within our records and the subsequent generation of their professional credentials.

Terms of Usage and Refund Policy
Because the administrative expenses regarding code verification setup, unique ID generation, and the processing of certification records are incurred by Zensoratech immediately upon request, once the evaluation process has commenced or the certificate has been issued, the fee is non-refundable, except in cases of duplicate payment or verified technical error. Furthermore, it must be understood without ambiguity that the payment of this fee provides access strictly to the assessment evaluation and certification issuance services; it does not constitute a purchase of employment, nor does it serve as a binding guarantee of a future job offer, permanent placement, or contract extension with Zensoratech or any of its third-party affiliates.

Separation of Services and Training Programs
Zensoratech operates both educational training programs and commercial IT services. Participation in any internship or training program does not imply involvement in paid client work. Any commercial services offered by Zensoratech are executed independently of the internship program.
